# DIY Film Camera

This repository documents the build of a homemade motion picture film camera.
Simple camera mostly 3D printed and using off the shelf parts.

## Features

- 35mm film <sub>120 film mod possible for more area</sub>
- Sony E mount for interchangeable lenses
- Manual variable framerate <sub>for extended filming time</sub>
- Individual motors for each function <sub>simplified, no gears</sub>
- NEMA 8 stepper for shutter, NEMA 8/11/14/17 options for film advance
- 3x CR123A batteries with USB-C charging

## How it Works

Uses separate motors for each function instead of complex gears. One motor spins the shutter disc, another advances the film.

## Status

- [x] Camera body designed in 3D  
- [ ] Components sourcing  
- [ ] Electrical diagram created  
- [ ] NEMA stepper motor closed-loop setup  
- [ ] Battery and BMS integration  
- [ ] Test roll completed

## Current Version: v11 

Latest iteration etc

### v10

Previous version etc

## Key Components

- 3D printed camera body and internal mechanisms
- NEMA 8/11 stepper motors for precision control
- Arduino or similar microcontroller for motor timing
- Custom PCB for power management and motor drivers
- Standard 35mm film cartridges

## Files

- `/media` - Photos and videos of the camera
- `/files` - 3D models, schematics, code

## Notes

This is an ongoing project. The design prioritizes simplicity, affordability and compactness. All major components should be easily sourceable and the 3D printed parts can be modified as needed.
